# qri-googlesheets

A simple ETL script that pulls a CSV from a google sheet, commits the CSV to a new version of a qri dataset, and publishes the dataset to qri.cloud.

# How to use

The google sheet url and the qri dataset name are hard-coded, but you should be able to use this if you have qri CLI installed on your computer.

Install dependencies - `yarn`

Run `node script.js`
